You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee in using the Service provided by PayFast for the acceptance of funds through any means including, but not limited to, the acceptance of credit cards. This restriction does not prevent you from imposing a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services, as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge (in other words, the handling fee for transactions paid through the Service may not be higher than the handling fee for transactions paid through other payment methods).
17. DEPOSITS AND BALANCES

18. SECURITY
18.1 PayFast makes every effort to ensure the security and integrity of your account and we make use of sophisticated systems to accomplish this. You understand however, that there is a compromise made between the extent of these security systems and the inconvenience to you, the user.

18.3 PayFast strongly suggests that you use a web browser with 128-bit encryption or better. However, regardless of whether you use a web browser with security features or not, PayFast is unable to guarantee that data transmitted and is secure and/or will not be intercepted by third parties.

18.4 Phishing is a form of fraud where criminals attempt to access your confidential information. This is done by an email request for information, by luring you to a fake website or some other such means. In any case of phishing, PayFast will respond as quickly as possible to alert users to the threat or to mitigate the threat. No guarentee is given as to this action however, and PayFast will not be held liable for any funds lost as a result of a User falling prey to a phishing attack. It is the responsibility of the User to be aware of such potential threats, to avoid them and to report them to PayFast upon discovery.

18.5 PayFast reserves the right to implement any security measures deemed appropriate to lower or negate fraudulent transactions, which may result in certain payments a User (as a receiver), or from a User (as a sender), being disallowed.
19. FEES
